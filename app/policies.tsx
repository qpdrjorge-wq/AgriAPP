              market access. To ensure a safe, accessible, and supportive environment for all users, the following policies 
              have been established.

              AgriCraft supports secure and accessible payment methods, including e-wallets (GCash, PayMaya), and cash on 
              delivery (COD). All transactions are processed securely, and transaction history is maintained for both buyers

              must adhere to the individual seller's shop policy. To initiate a return, buyers should first contact the seller. 
              If unresolved, the issue can be escalated to AgriCraft admin for assistance.

              AgriCraft is exclusively for Senior Citizens, PWDs, Youth, and marginalized farmers. Sellers must verify their 
              identity using a valid National ID and confirm their contact information during registration. A short biography 
              and shop description are required to build trust with buyers. All seller accounts are subject to admin approval 
              before they can list products.

              Sellers may list handmade crafts and fresh farm produce. All products must be accurately represented with clear 
              photos, honest descriptions, and fair pricing. Prohibited items include mass-produced goods, counterfeit products, 
              and items that do not adhere to platform standards. Sellers are responsible for ensuring their listings comply with 
              these guidelines.

              Sellers can create their own return and refund policies, provided they meet AgriCraft's minimum standards. 
              Sellers are expected to maintain up-to-date shop information, respond to customer inquiries promptly, and process 
              orders in a timely manner. Shop policies must be clearly communicated to buyers.
